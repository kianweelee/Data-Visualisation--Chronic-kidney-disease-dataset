# Data-Visualisation--Chronic-kidney-disease-dataset
Exploratory data analysis on chronic kidney dataset from Kaggle

## Why this dataset?
Chronic kidney disease(CKD) occurs when the kidneys have issues removing toxins from the body, leading to the accumulation of waste products that are harmful to the body. This dataset explored multiple attributes that could be the leading factors to this disease and my objective here is to identify correlations between these attributes and CKD.
