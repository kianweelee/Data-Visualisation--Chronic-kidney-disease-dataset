If one doesn't function well, the burdens get carried over to the second kidney. If the patient fails to take drastic measures to improve his/her condition, both kidneys will fail, leading to acute renal failure. This can be fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. Of course, this occurs at the advance stage of chronic kidney disease and symptoms will only show up at a severe stage. \n\n# Purpose of this project\n- We will like to find out the correlation between these health attributes and chronic kidney disease.\n    * This way we can allow early detections that facilitate medical interventions\n- Identify key precursors to chronic kidney disease that can be used for machine learning "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing packages \n- Here we will import required packages, namely Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scipy.stats"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing packages\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns \nimport scipy.stats # Needed to compute statistics for categorical data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing dataset into notebook and previewing it"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"kidney_data = pd.read_csv('../input/ckdisease/kidney_disease.csv')\nkidney_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Check for any unknown, NaN or NULL values"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"kidney_data.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dealing with NaN values \n- There are numerous way we can deal with this.
